Calculus
========

A torch7 package to do differentiation and integration over arbitrary Tensors, using a variety of methods.

Some of the methods are:
- First and Second order differentiation using finite-difference

Soon to come:
- Integration by Simpson's Rule
- Integration using Monte-Carlo method

This package was inspired by Julia's [Calculus package](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/Calculus.jl)
